**Lentz-Nielsen, Nicki**., Madeleine, Pascal (2022), Validation of football locomotion categories derived from inertial measurements
*Under peer-review*

The code consist of 2 main .qmd files and 2 .R files
 * **00-import_and_clean_data.qmd:** imports, cleans and mappes the data to the correct participants.
 * **01-ValidateLocomotion.qmd:** Transforms  and validates the locomotion categories
 * **cleanFMPdata.R:** Function used for to clean the provided football movement profile data
 * **extractAthleteName.R:** To secure correct mapping of the players for each data collection, a script was created to extract the names.
